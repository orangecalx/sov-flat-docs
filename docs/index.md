# *SUMMARY*
<br>

Sovereign is a DTMF audio mangler / ring mod / chaotic audio generator DTMF based off a DTMF (dial tone multi-frequency) tone decoder IC by Phillips Semiconductors. This new version adds a hi / low *RANGE SWITCH*, a very weird *FEEDBACK LOOP*, *TUNE CV ATTENUATION*, and *GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS AND UPDATES* in a *DESIREABLE 6HP PACKAGE*. 

Input signals are compared to the tunable internal VCO of the IC,and depending on their compatibilty are mangled in a way that ostensibly is similar to a tradiational ring modulator circuit. Sovereign is as much a sound effector as it is a sound generator, living comfortably between the two arbitrarily binary classes.

# *SPECIFICATIONS*
<br>

- __6HP wide__ (wow) 
- Skiff-friendly
- (roughly) 50ma on +12v, 40ma on -12
- 1kOhm input / 100kOhm output impedence
- Vactrol tune control w/ CV in
- Starve control
- insane

# *FUNCTIONS / CONTROLS*	
		
<br>

<img src="vector-mkdocs2.png">

<br>
		 
- <font size="5">__*TUNE*__</font>
	
	PLL comparison oscillator control. Ranges from tremolo-range to khz audio depending on RANGE switch. Acts as offset when using TUNE CV.

	
	
<br>		
				
- <font size="5">__*TUNE CV*__</font> 
	
	CV control of TUNE, with attenuation control. Please god do not expect 1v/oct. 
	
<br>
		
- <font size="5">__*STARVE*__</font>

	Controls amt of power sent to main PLL chip. *Please note! - volume will vary drastically at different STARVE settings!*
	

	
<br>	
	
- <font size="5">__*LO RANGE / HI RANGE*__</font>
	
	PLL tuning range. 
	


<br>	
	
- <font size="5">__*MODE*__</font>
	
	M1 = EFFECTOR mode, incoming signals are mangled and then output.
	M2 = EMITTER mode, input and output are wired together for vaguely oscillator-like operation.


<br>	
	
- <font size="5">__*FEEDBACK LOOP SEND / RETURN*__</font>
	
	Pre-PLL feedback loop. When in EMITTER MODE, patch filters, delays, reverbs, etc here to place them in between the PLL's input and output. *The feedback loop is within the PLL and will thus sound absolutely disgusting - do not expect a conventional feedback loop!*
	

<br>	
	
- <font size="5">__*INPUT / OUTPUT*__</font>
	
	
	See above. Eurorack "standard"-compliant 1kΩ input / 100kΩ output impedance.

# TIPS / TRICKS
<br>

- The STARVE control has a dead zone at the lowest settings. This could be good if you hate how it sounds. 

- At the lower extremes, the Sovereign acts more like a very choppy tremolo, slightly reactive to input amplitude.

- In EMITTER (M2) mode, a high enough STARVE setting results in strange sequenced noises. try to replicate the sound in your head on the Sovereign.

- There’s a certain setting that we can’t talk about here. We can’t say any more right now.
