# BUILD NOTES
<br>

- The LED placement location is above R2 and R5 - **orient the flat side of the LEDs to the flat side of the silkscreen**

- This is a tightly packed module - place the smaller components first, and the jacks last. You may have to (gingerly, gently) move some components out of the way if they bump up against the jacks, but for the most part we've done a pretty good job in the space efficiency department.

- Solder one capacitor on the front side of the board, and the other on the back. This is a neccessary step to get the slightly larger 1uF MLC (multilayer ceramic) capacitors on the board. 

- Since it's passive, power is not needed, and thankfully you won't have to check for shorts!
