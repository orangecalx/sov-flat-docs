This new version adds a hi / low RANGE SWITCH , a very weird FEEDBACK LOOP , TUNE CV ATTENUATION , and GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS AND UPDATES in a DESIREABLE 6HP PACKAGE . Input signals are compared to the tunable internal VCO of the IC,and depending on their compatibilty are mangled in a way that ostensibly is similar to a tradiational ring modulator circuit. Sovereign is as much a sound effector as it is a sound generator, living comfortably between the two arbitrarily binary classes. SPECIFICATIONS 6HP wide (wow) Skiff-friendly (roughly) 50ma on +12v, 40ma on -12 1kOhm input / 100kOhm output impedence Vactrol tune control w/ CV in Starve control insane FUNCTIONS / CONTROLS TUNE PLL comparison oscillator control. Ranges from tremolo-range to khz audio depending on RANGE switch. Acts as offset when using TUNE CV. TUNE CV CV control of TUNE, with attenuation control. Please god do not expect 1v/oct. STARVE Controls amt of power sent to main PLL chip. Please note! - volume will vary drastically at different STARVE settings! LO RANGE / HI RANGE PLL tuning range. MODE M1 = EFFECTOR mode, incoming signals are mangled and then output. M2 = EMITTER mode, input and output are wired together for vaguely oscillator-like operation. FEEDBACK LOOP SEND / RETURN Pre-PLL feedback loop. When in EMITTER MODE, patch filters, delays, reverbs, etc here to place them in between the PLL's input and output. The feedback loop is within the PLL and will thus sound absolutely disgusting - do not expect a conventional feedback loop! INPUT / OUTPUT See above. Eurorack \"standard\"-compliant 1k\u03a9 input / 100k\u03a9 output impedance. TIPS / TRICKS The STARVE control has a dead zone at the lowest settings. This could be good if you hate how it sounds. At the lower extremes, the Sovereign acts more like a very choppy tremolo, slightly reactive to input amplitude. In EMITTER (M2) mode, a high enough STARVE setting results in strange sequenced noises. try to replicate the sound in your head on the Sovereign. There\u2019s a certain setting that we can\u2019t talk about here. We can\u2019t say any more right now.

BUILD NOTES The LED placement location is above R2 and R5 - orient the flat side of the LEDs to the flat side of the silkscreen This is a tightly packed module - place the smaller components first, and the jacks last. You may have to (gingerly, gently) move some components out of the way if they bump up against the jacks, but for the most part we've done a pretty good job in the space efficiency department. Solder one capacitor on the front side of the board, and the other on the back. This is a neccessary step to get the slightly larger 1uF MLC (multilayer ceramic) capacitors on the board. Since it's passive, power is not needed, and thankfully you won't have to check for shorts!
